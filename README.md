# Playground
Repository for small practice exercises to keep my skills sharp.

Current exercises:
  1) Reversing an array:
        - Given a user inputted array with a user inputted size, this will reverse the array.
  2) Unordered linked list using class templates
        - User inputs values into a linked list which is then printed.
